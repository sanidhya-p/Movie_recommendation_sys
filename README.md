# Movie_recommendation_sys
In this project, we'll learn how to create a movie recommendation system using Jupyter, Python, and Pandas.
We'll be able to type the name of a movie into an input box, and instantly get recommendations for other movies we might like. 

We have MovieLens 25M dataset, which contains movie reviews and ratings.
Then, we'll make search engine to find a specific movie title in our data.
We'll then be able to create a recommendation engine to recommend specific movies using *Collaborative FIltering*

## Recommendations
Based on the movie that we give in the search box we will get recommendations
